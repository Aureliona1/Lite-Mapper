# Documentation

Welcome to the Lite-Mapper documentation!
This document covers most of the main aspects of Lite-Mapper, but is not a complete list.

Lite-Mapper is made to follow a very similar syntax to [ReMapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper) with some minor differences.
It aims to be a more "barebones" alternative to ReMapper that works very closely to the raw JSON form of maps.

If you are looking for a more feature rich library to Lite-Mapper, then look into learning [ReMapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper).

Otherwise, welcome to Lite-Mapper!

## Pull Requests / Updates

If you see an issue with Lite-Mapper, or would like to add a feature to the library, then feel free to create a pull request. Lite-Mapper is currently only maintained by Aurellis (me), so there may be a bit of a delay before pull requests get merged. But 99/100 times it will be approved.
